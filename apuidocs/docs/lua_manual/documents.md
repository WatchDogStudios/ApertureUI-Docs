### Interface

- [Document Lua API reference](api_reference.html#Document)
- [Document C++ manual](../cpp_manual/documents.html)

All properties and methods that are available for documents are described in detail in the API reference. The document-specific interface is similar to the C++ interface, refer there for the full documentation.

Documents derive from elements, and so they inherit the [Element interface](elements.html#interface).
