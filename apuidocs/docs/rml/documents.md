### \<rml\>

All RmlUi documents begin with the `<rml>`{:.tag} element. The element should contain two children, `<head>`{:.tag} and `<body>`{:.tag}, as shown in the following basic structure of a document.

```html
<rml>
	<head>
		<title>...</title>
		<link type="text/rcss" href="style.rcss"/>
		...
	</head>
	<body>
		...
	</body>
</rml>
```

### \<head\>

The `<head>`{:.tag} element contains information about the current document, such as its title, style and template information is references. No information in the header is rendered.

### \<title\>

The `<title>`{:.tag} element contains the title of the document. This is often used for the specifying the contents of the title bar of a game window.

### \<link\>

The `<link>`{:.tag} element is used to specify additional resources the document requires.
