		<title>...</title>
		<link type="text/css" href="style.css"/>
		...
	</head>
	<body>
		...
	</body>
</rml>
```

### \<head\>

The `<head>` element contains information about the current document, such as its title, style and template information is references. No information in the header is rendered.

### \<title\>

The `<title>` element contains the title of the document. This is often used for the specifying the contents of the title bar of a game window.
