See also [element packages]({{"pages/cpp_manual/element_packages.html"|relative_url}}) in the C++ manual for controlling the behavior of several of these elements.

APUI does not provide a default style sheet, thus, tags which only represent a specific style rule in HTML have no special meaning in APUI, such as `<div>`, `<span>` and `<table>`. Users can include the [recommended style sheet](html4_style_sheet.html) to enable common rules for these tags.

The following elements are additionally enabled when including their respective plugins:

- [`<lottie>`](../cpp_manual/lottie.html)
- [`<svg>`](../cpp_manual/svg.html)

Deprecated elements:

- [`<datagrid>`](deprecated.html#datagrid)
- [`<col>`](deprecated.html#col)
- [`<dataselect>`](deprecated.html#dataselect)

Users are encouraged to replace these elements with [data bindings](../data_bindings.html) possibly combined with [CSS tables](../css/tables.html).
