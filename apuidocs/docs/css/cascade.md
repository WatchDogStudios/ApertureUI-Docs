This functionality of CSS is identical to that defined in [CSS2](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/cascade.html); please refer there for documentation. Important things to be aware of:

* APUI has no built-in UA style sheet.
* The `!important` tag is not yet supported.
* The `inherit` rule is not yet supported.
