The `tiled-vertical` decorator can render three sprites or images, vertically across an element. One image is placed on the top edge, another on the bottom edge, and the last is stretched across the middle.

The decorator renders across the padded area of its element.

```css
decorator: tiled-horizontal( 
	<top-image-src> <top-image-orientation>,  
	<center-image-src> <center-image-orientation>,
	<bottom-image-src> <bottom-image-orientation>
);
```

The `<x-orientation>` properties can be omitted, which leaves them at their default values.
