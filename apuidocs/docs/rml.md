RML is based around the [HTML5 standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/), and in particular uses the [XML syntax](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/xhtml.html) for document markup. However, element names are (mostly) open-ended in RML and can be used in any way that is logical for your application. All documents follow strict [XML 1.0 specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/) and where possible all RmlUi elements follow their HTML equivalent.

RML maintains the core components of HTML5, including CSS. It provides a number of basic elements including input fields, radio buttons and check boxes as well as more complex enhancements such as templates and datagrids.
