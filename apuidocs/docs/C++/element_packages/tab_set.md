APUI comes with a tab set control for breaking up content over multiple tabbed panels. The control has a list of tabs which are always visible and can be clicked on to display their associated panel. Only one panel is visible at any one time.

You can find the HTML documentation for the tab set element [here]({{"pages/rml/controls.html#tabset"|relative_url}}).

Here is an HTML sample demonstrating the declaration of a tab set:

```html
<rml>
<head>
</head>
<body>
	<tabset>
		<tab><img src="tab1.jpg" />Tab 1</tab>
		<panel>
			Welcome to the first tab!
		</panel>
		<tab><img src="tab2.jpg" />Tab 2</tab>
		<panel>
			Welcome to the second tab!
		</panel>
	</tabset>
...
</rml>
```

The `apui::ElementTabSet` class (found in `<APUI/Core/Elements/ElementTabSet.h>`) defines the interface to tab set elements.

The function `GetNumTabs()` will return the number of panels within the tab set.

```cpp
// Retrieve the number of tabs in the tab set.
// @return The number of tabs.
int GetNumTabs();
```

### Setting active tab

The following functions will let the active tab be changed and retrieved.

```cpp
// Sets the currently active (visible) tab index.
// @param[in] tab_index Index of the tab to display.
void SetActiveTab(int tab_index);

// Get the current active tab index.
// @return The index of the active tab.
int GetActiveTab() const;
```

When a certain tab is activated, only the corresponding panel is visible. The other panels will have their `display` property set to `none`.

### Setting tab content

Through C++, the contents of the panel tabs can be set to either unparsed HTML or an existing element hierarchy.

```cpp
// Sets the specifed tab index's tab title HTML.
// @param[in] tab_index The tab index to set. If it doesn't already exist, it will be created.
// @param[in] rml The HTML to set on the tab title.
void SetTab(int tab_index, const apui::String& rml);

// Set the specifed tab index's title element.
// @param[in] tab_index The tab index to set. If it doesn't already exist, it will be created.
// @param[in] element The root of the element tree to set as the tab title.
void SetTab(int tab_index, apui::ElementPtr element);
```

When the contents of a tab is set, it will replace whatever it had before. If you specify a tab index that doesn't exist, it will be created. The second function takes an `ElementPtr`, thus, the function takes ownership of the given element. Raw pointers cannot be used, they must first be removed from their parent if located in a hierarchy.

Note that these functions only set the content of the tab buttons, not the panels themselves.

### Setting panel content

Similarly to the panel tabs, the content of the panels themselves can be set to unparsed HTML or an existing element.

```cpp
// Sets the specifed tab index's tab panel HTML.
// @param[in] tab_index The tab index to set. If it doesn't already exist, it will be created.
// @param[in] rml The HTML to set on the tab panel.
void SetPanel(int tab_index, const apui::String& rml);

// Set the specified tab index's body element.
// @param[in] tab_index The tab index to set. If it doesn't already exist, it will be created.
// @param[in] element The root of the element tree to set as the window.
void SetPanel(int tab_index, apui::ElementPtr element);
```

### Removing panels

The `RemoveTab()` function will remove an existing tab and its panel from the tab set.

```cpp
// Remove one of the tab set's panels and its corresponding tab.
// @param[in] tab_index The tab index to remove. If no tab matches this index, nothing will be removed.
void RemoveTab(int tab_index);
```

### Applying properties

Tab sets and their elements can have properties applied on them like other elements, and will need to in order to be positioned correctly. For a horizontal layout, the `display` properties of tabs should be set to `inline-block`. For panels, the `display` can be set to `block` for typical layout scenarios. Note that panels will automatically have their `display` property set to `none` on the local element style when they are not the active tab. Subsequently, when a panel is activated the `display` property is removed from the local element style, effectively activating the property set in the CSS document. Thus, ensure that the `display` property is added to the CSS document rather than as inline style for panel elements.

The diagram below details the internal hierarchy of the tab set.

The tab set element itself (tagged tabset) will have two child elements, panels, which holds all the panel elements, and tabs, which holds all the tab elements. Each of the panel and tab elements hold arbitrary HTML content. A typical CSS definition for a tab set would be follows:

```css
/* Force the tabset element to a fixed size. */
tabset
{
	display: block;
	width: 300px;
	height: 200px;
}

/* Display the tab container as a block element 20 pixels high; it will
   be positioned at the top of the tabset. */
tabset tabs
{
	display: block;
	height: 20px;
}

/* Force each tab to only take up 50 pixels across the tabs element. */
tabset tab
{
	display: inline-block;
	width: 50px;
}

/* Display the panel container as a block element 180 pixels high; it will
   be positioned below the tab container and take up the rest of the space
   in the tabset. */
tabset panels
{
	display: block;
	height: 180px;
}

/* Fix each panel to take up exactly the panelled space. */
tabset panels panel
{
	display: block;
	width: 100%;
	height: 100%;
}
```

The order of the panels and tabs elements is determined by the HTML order; if a panel element is encountered before a tab element, the panels element will be created first, and vice versa. This way, you can create a tab set with tabs on the bottom or top.
