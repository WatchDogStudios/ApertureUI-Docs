This document defines the *CSS Cascading Style Sheets* language. CSS is based on the [CSS2 specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/), with certain elements removed or altered to suit the needs of APUI. In some cases, elements have been taken from the [CSS3 working draft](http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/current-work). This document provides an overview of CSS and the differences between CSS and CSS, and should be read in conjunction with the CSS2 specification.

CSS interacts with HTML in an identical fashion to CSS and HTML. Style properties declared in a CSS are attached selectively to elements defined in HTML to affect layout, positioning and other style attributes (such as font, color, text decoration, etc).

If you are familiar with CSS, a good place to start is the [property index](CSS/property_index.html), which outlines the properties and values supported in CSS and the new functionality included. Next, read up on [decorators](CSS/decorators.html), the new, flexible way to skin elements.

If you are not, read through this documentation while consulting the CSS2 specification for detailed examples and technical details, or skip all this for now and play around with the samples!
