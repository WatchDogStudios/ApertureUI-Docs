Font effects are an extension to CSS for RCSS for applying effects, such as outlining or shadowing, to text. Similarly to [decorators](decorators.html), font effects are declared and named in a style sheet like a property, and configured with font-effect-specific properties. Custom font effects can be developed to apply arbitrary effects onto text.

### Properties
{:#font-effect}

Font effects are declared and configured within style sheets similar to how decorators are declared.

`font-effect`

Value: | none \| \<type\>( \<properties\> )
Initial: | none
Inherited: | yes
Percentages: | N/A

`<type>` is a font effect type, and `<properties>` specify the properties of the given decorator type.

Multiple font effects can also be specified, eg.
```css
font-effect: <type>( <properties> ), <type>( <properties> ), ... ;
```
Multiple font effects are applied in reverse order.

Note that there is no RCSS at-rule for font effects as there is for decorators. Thus, the `font-effect` property cannot take a name.

#### Inheritance

Unlike decorators, font effects are inherited from parent elements. For example, the following declaration:

```css
h1
{
	font-effect: outline(2px black);
}
```

will add an outline to the text within all `h1`{:.tag} elements and their descendants. To prevent inheritance, override the effect with `none`. For example, to prevent the `h1`{:.tag} outline effect from affecting `span`{:.tag} elements, you could specify the following:

```css
h1 span
{
	font-effect: none;
}
```

### Effects

RmlUi comes with the following built-in font effects:

1. [glow effect](font_effects/glow.html), for glowing text.
2. [outline effect](font_effects/outline.html), for outlining text.
3. [shadow effect](font_effects/shadow.html), for rendering shadows.
4. [blur effect](font_effects/blur.html), for blurring text.
